# It should be safe to just run this script on Ubuntu. gdb-multiarch recently
# became required for vscode to set 32-bit breakpoints reliably. vscode is
# recommended because it is already configured but is not required or installed
# here. google-chrome will also be launched when a web page is generated if it
# is available but is not required or installed here.
