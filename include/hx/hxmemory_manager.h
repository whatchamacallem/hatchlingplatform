/// \file hx/hxmemory_manager.h Memory Manager C API. Memory allocators are
/// selected using an id. These are the large system-wide allocators, not the
/// per-container hxallocator which allocates from here.
///
/// General purpose memory allocators are inefficient and unsafe to use. The
/// problem is that long running code requires a lot of extra space to make sure
/// it doesn't fragment and unexpectedly fail to make a large allocation.
/// (Hardware support for virtual memory can be used to defrag the program heap,
/// but that requires processor support and system call overhead.) For code that
/// uses a lot of small intermediate allocations 1/3 of your memory and 1/3 or
/// your processor time could get eaten by the program heap allocator. The
/// hxsystem_allocator_temporary_stack is provided as a replacement in that
/// case.
///
/// There are also a category of allocations that are expected to last for the
/// lifetime of the application. They can be allocated with 0 overhead using
/// hxsystem_allocator_permanent.
///
/// NOTA BENE: The current allocator id is a thread local attribute that is
/// managed by the `hxsystem_allocator_scope` RAII class. This provides a non-
/// intrusive way to move swaths of code to different allocators.
///
/// Alignment must be a power of two. (It always is.)
///
/// `HX_RELEASE < 1` default memory markings:
///
/// - `0xab` - Allocated to client code.
/// - `0xbc` - Allocated to hxallocator dynamic allocation.
/// - `0xcd` - Belongs to system allocator.
/// - `0xde` - Returned to heap allocator.
/// - `0xef` - Reserved for client poisoned data.
///
/// Global new and delete are provided when `HX_NO_LIBCXX==1`. This is a
/// requirement for running as a stand alone C++ runtime. Otherwise they are not
/// interfered with. Those default versions do not use the memory manager's
/// current allocator id because it may not be safe to do so. `hxnew` and
/// `hxdelete` are available as substitutes.
///
/// It should be possible to implement a triple buffered streaming strategy
/// for data processing by adding a two more temp stacks. An open world video
/// game would require even more temp stacks. This would require modifying the
/// existing code.
