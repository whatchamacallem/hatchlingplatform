/// \file hx/hxmemory_manager.h Memory Manager C API. Memory allocators are
/// selected using an ID. These are the large system-wide allocators, not the
/// per-container `hxallocator` which allocates from here.
///
/// General purpose memory allocators are inefficient and unsafe to use. The
/// problem is that long running code requires a lot of extra space to make sure
/// it doesn't fragment and unexpectedly fail to make a large allocation.
/// (Hardware support for virtual memory can be used to defrag the program heap,
/// but that requires processor support and system call overhead.) For code that
/// uses a lot of small intermediate allocations 1/3 of your memory and 1/3 or
/// your processor time could get eaten by the program heap allocator. The
/// `hxsystem_allocator_temporary_stack` is provided as a replacement in that
/// case.
///
/// There are also a category of allocations that are expected to last for the
/// lifetime of the application. They can be allocated with 0 overhead using
/// `hxsystem_allocator_permanent`.
///
/// NOTA BENE: The current allocator ID is a thread local attribute that is
/// managed by the `hxsystem_allocator_scope` RAII class. This provides a non-
/// intrusive way to move swaths of code to different allocators.
///
/// Alignment must be a power of two. (It always is.)
///
/// `HX_RELEASE == 0` debug memory byte patterns:
///
/// | Hex    | Decimal | Pattern Description                              |
/// | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
/// | `0xab` | 171     | Allocated to client code.                        |
/// | `0xbc` | 188     | Allocated to `hxallocator` dynamic allocation.   |
/// | `0xcd` | 205     | Belongs to system allocator.                     |
/// | `0xde` | 222     | Returned to heap allocator.                      |
/// | `0xef` | 239     | Reserved for client poisoned data. Also `0xefu`. |
///
/// Global new and delete are provided when `HX_NO_LIBCXX==1`. This is a
/// requirement for running as a stand alone C++ runtime. Otherwise they are not
/// interfered with. Those default versions do not use the memory manager's
/// current allocator because it may not be safe to do so. `hxnew` and
/// `hxdelete` are available as recommended substitutes.
///
/// It should be possible to implement a triple buffered streaming strategy
/// for DMA by adding a two more temp stacks.
