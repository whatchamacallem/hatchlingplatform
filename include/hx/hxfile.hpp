/// code will do your error handling for you if you let it. From an optimization
/// perspective, `printf`/`scanf` turn out to be bytecode interpreters and those
/// are hard to compete with for code size. `gcc` is recommended for validating
/// their arguments when used in untested error handling. However, memory imaged
/// data structres are still recommended because they have predictable memory
/// allocation requirements and can be served by a dma controller. Finally, this

/// entire constellation of standard library file interfaces. To switch to using
