# Here is how to check that the package was installed correctly.

# Create a virtual environment and install the package into it.
./testpythonbindings.sh

# Activate the virtual environment so you can debug in it.
. bin/python_venv/bin/activate

# Check that your files were actually copied.
pip show -f entanglement_example

# At this point you can muck around running code on the Python command line.
# Or even go hack on the installed package.
python -c 'import entanglement_example; print(entanglement_example.__file__)'

# Exit the virtual environment before running ./testpythonbindings.sh again.
deactivate
